# Micro-SaaS Ideas v2

Three original Micro-SaaS ideas focusing on profitable niches.

## 1. Marketplace Profit Shield
**Category:** E-commerce/Marketplace Tools (Amazon/Etsy/Walmart calculators)  
**Description:** A browser extension and web dashboard that automatically audits marketplace fees for sellers, detecting overcharges and calculating true net profit per order. It cross‑references transactions against each platform’s fee policies and flags discrepancies (incorrect referral fees, unapplied discounts, excessive shipping charges). Sellers can connect their stores via API or upload CSV reports.  
**Target Audience:** Small to medium‑size sellers on Amazon, Etsy, and Walmart Marketplace.  
**Revenue Model:** Freemium – free up to 100 transactions/month; paid tiers from $19–$49/month based on volume and number of platforms.

## 2. Freelance Guard
**Category:** Legal/Contract Generators for Freelancers  
**Description:** An AI‑powered contract builder that creates custom agreements for freelancers in creative and technical fields. The tool asks a series of questions about the project (scope, deliverables, payment schedule, IP ownership) and dynamically assembles a legally‑sound contract, with plain‑English explanations of each clause. It also includes a “risk‑review” mode that scans uploaded existing contracts for missing or unfavorable terms.  
**Target Audience:** Freelancers in design, development, writing, and consulting.  
**Revenue Model:** One‑time purchase per contract ($29) or unlimited monthly subscription ($15/month, includes e‑signing and cloud storage).

## 3. Thumbnail Lab
**Category:** YouTube/Creator Tools (thumbnails/SEO)  
**Description:** A web‑based thumbnail creator that uses AI to suggest engaging compositions based on the video’s topic and previous high‑performing thumbnails in the niche. Features include automated background removal, text‑overlay suggestions, and color‑grading presets optimized for CTR. Includes a built‑in A/B testing panel that integrates with YouTube’s thumbnail split‑testing feature (when available) or uses a custom URL‑tracking dashboard for off‑platform tests.  
**Target Audience:** YouTube creators, video marketers, and small media teams.  
**Revenue Model:** Free tier with limited exports; Pro plans at $12/month (unlimited exports, premium templates) and $29/month (A/B testing analytics, AI suggestions).
