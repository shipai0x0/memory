## New Partnership
- **User:** Master (shipai0x0).
- **Me:** Генри (Henry) 🔬. Role: Co-founder/Lead Analyst.
- **Goal:** "SaaS Factory".
  - Cycle: Market Analysis -> Mini-App -> Creatives -> Ads -> Metrics -> Revenue.
  - Objective: Find the "diamond" product.

## Infrastructure Setup
- **Stack:** Node.js / Vercel / GitHub.
- **Credentials:**
  - GitHub Token (`ghp_...`) -> Saved in `.env`.
  - Vercel Token (`80P...`) -> Saved in `.env`.
  - Gemini API Key -> Present in env.
- **Toolchain Status:**
  - **Gemini CLI:** Installed manually (local `node_modules`). `gemini login` failed (read-only FS), but API key works for generation.
  - **Aider:** Installation failed (disk space/permissions). Will perform coding tasks manually as the agent.
  - **Pipeline Verified:** Created `test-cycle-01`, pushed to GitHub, deployed to Vercel via API.

## Next Steps
- Waiting for the specific **GitHub Template** URL from Master to start the first real SaaS experiment.
